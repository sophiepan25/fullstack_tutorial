# Full Stack Tutorial

This project is a **fantastic introduction to Full Stack Development** for a freshman Computer Science student. It teaches the core idea of separating the **Client** (what the user sees) from the **Server** (where logic and data live).

For this tutorial, we use:

- **Frontend:** React  
- **Backend:** Python with Flask  

This is a **beginner-friendly, industry-relevant stack** that clearly demonstrates professional development practices.

## Architecture Overview

Before coding, it helps to visualize what we are building:

- **Frontend (React):**  
  Runs in the browser and requests data.
- **Backend (Flask):**  
  Runs on the server, processes logic, and sends data back.

## 1. Professional Directory Structure

In a professional environment, frontend and backend code are separated into distinct folders. This prevents dependency conflicts (e.g., `node_modules` vs. Python `venv`).
